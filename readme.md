# WineMem
A CheatEngine clone designed for use on Linux systems with the goal of hacking games running on Proton or Wine. Linux processes aren't safe either, however!

## Why?
My Windows drive broke so I gotta use Linux now. Found the current Linux game hacking tools rather underwhelming, and CheatEngine can be a hassle... especially on Proton.
